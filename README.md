# Hearts
Hearts is a trick-taking card game for 4 players.\
\
The objective of the game is to avoid collecting hearts and the Queen of Spades because they carry penalty points. The player with the fewest penalty points at the end of the game wins.
## How to play
**Passing Cards:** Before the first trick, players must pass 3 cards to the player to their left. In the first round, pass 3 cards to the left. In the second round, pass 3 cards to the right. In the third round, pass 3 cards to the player across from you. In the fourth round, no cards are passed. The passing phase adds strategic depth to the game.\
\
**Leading Trick:** The player with the 2 of Clubs leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can; otherwise, they can play any card. The player who plays the highest-ranking card of the leading suit wins the trick and leads the next trick.\
\
**Hearts:** Players are not allowed to lead with Hearts until Hearts have been "broken." Hearts are broken when a player cannot follow suit and plays a Heart card instead. After Hearts are broken, players can lead with Hearts.\
\
**Scoring:** At the end of each hand, players count the penalty points they've collected:
- Each Heart card: 1 point
- Queen of Spades: 13 points
  
**Winning the Game:** The game usually consists of multiple rounds (hands), and the player with the fewest penalty points at the end of all rounds wins the game.\
